(SuperAgent)[https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/]
SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!

A request can be initiated by invoking the appropriate method on the request object, then calling .then() (or .end() or await) to send the request.

 request
   .get('/search')
   .then(res => {
      // res.body, res.headers, res.status
   })
   .catch(err => {
      // err.message, err.response
   });
