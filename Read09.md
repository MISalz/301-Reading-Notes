## [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming is pure functions. But what does that really mean? What makes a function pure?
So how do we know if a function is pure or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

If our function reads external files, it’s not a pure function — the file’s contents can change.

Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.

It does not cause any observable side effects
Examples of observable side effects include modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.
