# Diversity and Inclusion

the Gendergap is something that has been discussed for many years now in the technical side of the job market. It has been primarily dominated by White males. Although its been occupied by this particular type of people the interest has been been with a wider range of people not all who have had access to the technology, education and support from their communities and homes in order to pursue this type of career path. 

In the past few years more and more companies are looking to diversify their talent with minorities and female staff by seeking talent with and without prior formal education. The support also comes from scholarships, stem programs and funding elementary/highschooler education to increase interest in this field.
